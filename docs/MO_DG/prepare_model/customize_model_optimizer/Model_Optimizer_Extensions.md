Model Optimizer extensions enable you to inject some logic to the model conversion pipeline without changing the Model
Optimizer core code. There are three types of the Model Optimizer extensions:

1. [Model Optimizer operation](Model_Optimizer_Operation.md).
2. A [framework operation extractor](Model_Optimizer_Extractor.md).
3. A [model transformation](Model_Optimizer_Transformation_Extensions.md), which can be executed during front, middle or back phase of the model conversion.

An extension is just a plain text file with a Python code. The file should contain a class (or classes) inherited from
one of extension base classes. Extension files should be saved to a directory with the following structure:

```sh
./<MY_EXT>/
           ops/                  - custom operations
           front/                - framework independent front transformations
                 <FRAMEWORK_1>/  - front transformations for <FRAMEWORK_1> models only and extractors for <FRAMEWORK_1> operations
                 <FRAMEWORK_2>/  - front transformations for <FRAMEWORK_2> models only and extractors for <FRAMEWORK_2> operations
                 ...
           middle/               - middle transformations
           back/                 - back transformations
```

Model Optimizer uses the same layout internally to keep built-in extensions. The only exception is that the 
`mo/ops/` directory is also used as a source of the Model Optimizer operations due to historical reasons.

> **NOTE**: The name of a root directory with extensions should not be equal to "extensions" because it will result in a
> name conflict with the built-in Model Optimizer extensions.

> **NOTE**: Model Optimizer itself is built by using these extensions, so there is a huge number of examples of their
> usage in the Model Optimizer code.
